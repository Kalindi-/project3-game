hello!

answers to previous reviewer that might be useful to the new reviewer!

### PROJECT 3, review 1-2


Aiaia! wanted to do last minute slimming of project, and deleted images
 in the folder, without rechecking and remembering that they are present
 in the load code, so I apologize for this.

Did a few little suggested corrections, tried to catch the missing semicolons.
Refreshed my sublime settings (the tab vs indented spaces, that might look
the same for the eye, but actually show up differently on the review code.)


A few more precise questions/comments:

**index.html vs game.html**
I got the suggestion to rename my html file back to index.html from game.html.
I read a bit about it, and if i understood correctly it is because in some
cases index.html is automatically looked for.
If I am planning to add game.html to a project with many pages, it is than
better it stays called game.html? only in case it is the main page file,
does it make sense to call it index.html? in this case then, if it is the
only file, it would be handy to call it index.html.
I still felt like leaving it to be game.html, but i am up for changing my opinion.


**About inheritance.**
The previous reviewer suggested that I do some OOP including inheritance,
but it is a bit confusing for me. So please, if you could I'd be happy if you
could check what I did in my code.
If I understood correctly, the only thing that my three "creature" types
have in common, is that they need to be drawn. (all other things differ a
bit, and so I did not feel I could put them more together),
There is also this strange empty function at the beginning. Does this make
sense or what should I do?


**About the use of "use strict";**
Well, the previous reviewer proposed I add "use strict"; to my code.
I looked around for some info, and it is not that I understood it much,
but a bit, so I tried to implement it. I put it in every function, and
the code seems to still work. If you have an easy explanation I'd be happy
to hear.

**Validator errors**
There are very many validator errors.
Some are about variables without the var, which I am doing on purpose
because I want them to be accesible from other files.
Then there is the "unexpected this" error that I do not know what to do about.
basically, if they are there, chances are high, I do not know what to do about them,
so tips welcome  : )


Thank you for your time and effort!
Getting comments about my code is really important for me : )
